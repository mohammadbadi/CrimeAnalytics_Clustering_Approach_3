This project showcases my expertise in unsupervised machine learning by demonstrating how thoughtful, systematic analysis can control and extract insights from seemingly "black-box" methods. I analyzed auto theft patterns in Toronto using advanced clustering techniques—specifically KMeans and DBSCAN—to uncover hidden trends in the data. Rather than accepting the typical lack of control in unsupervised learning, I took charge by performing thorough Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), data cleansing, and data reduction. I employed the K-Elbow method to determine the optimal number of clusters and iteratively tested various feature combinations. By selecting the top five models and executing clustering on the full dataset, I ensured that the final results were robust and insightful. This rigorous approach underscores my critical thinking, smart coding practices, and adaptability in leveraging machine learning to solve real-world problems.
